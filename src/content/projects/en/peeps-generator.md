summary: "Peeps Generator is a Node.js library that allows you to programmatically generate illustrated avatars from modular pieces inspired by Open Peeps. It produces unique avatars—either random or reproducible via seed—and returns a complete SVG, ready to be rendered or exported to formats such as PNG, JPEG, WebP, or AVIF, making it suitable for backends, SSR applications, and image generation workflows where a consistent and flexible visual identity is required."
